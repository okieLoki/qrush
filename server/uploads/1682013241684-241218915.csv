When the pilots are ready, he'll send the F-16s.  Both Reznikov &amp; Danilov believe F-16s will be produced by a coalition of allies. 3/"

Even DJT while in office helped Ukraine. Thank you, yes I agree we need to stand together to protect democracy."

In Donesk, the same deal except they were covert russian paramilitary forces, not thugs."
